Typeshala but retro; and in space! With a fun little game that scratches your nostalgia itch if you ever were acquainted with the classic Space Invaders.

That's essentially what Space Type is. 

A typing trainer, tester, and game. But it's disguised as a game where you train to navigate a spaceship, test your skills, and use them to defend from incoming invaders.
